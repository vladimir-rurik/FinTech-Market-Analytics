## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FinTech-Market-Analytics.git
cd FinTech-Market-Analytics
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Requirements

#### TA‑Lib

**TA‑Lib** requires compiling the C library. You can install it in different ways:

- **Conda** (easiest cross-platform):
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib
  ```
- **Pip with precompiled wheel** (Windows users often use Gohlke’s wheels)  
  Or if you already have a local TA-Lib library installed, you can do:
  ```bash
  pip install ta-lib
  ```

#### backoff

This library helps with retries/exponential backoff for transient errors:
```bash
pip install backoff
```

#### Other Requirements

Finally, install the rest of the dependencies (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, etc.) listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Data Processing & Feature Engineering

```python
from market_analyzer import MarketDataAnalyzer
from market_analyzer.preprocessor import DataPreprocessor

# Initialize components
analyzer = MarketDataAnalyzer()
preprocessor = DataPreprocessor()

# Download and process data
analyzer.download_data(period="2y")
data = analyzer.get_asset_data('BTC-USD')
cleaned_data = preprocessor.clean_data(data)
features = preprocessor.engineer_features(cleaned_data)
```

### 2. Model Training & Evaluation

```python
from market_analyzer.ml_models import RandomForestStrategy, MLModelManager
from market_analyzer.experiment_tracker import ExperimentTracker

# Initialize components
model = RandomForestStrategy()
model_manager = MLModelManager()
tracker = ExperimentTracker()

# Train and evaluate
train_metrics = model_manager.train_model(model, train_features, train_data)
test_metrics = model_manager.evaluate_model(model, test_features, test_data)

# Track experiment
tracker.save_experiment(
    experiment_name='BTC_prediction',
    model_name='random_forest',
    train_metrics=train_metrics,
    test_metrics=test_metrics,
    validation_metrics=val_metrics,
    params=model.model_params
)
```

## Running the Analysis

The project includes three main scripts:

1. **Data Processing**:
```bash
python data_processing.py
```
- Downloads market data
- Performs preprocessing
- Generates features
- Creates data quality visualizations

2. **Model Training**:
```bash
python model_training.py
```
- Trains ML models
- Evaluates performance
- Tracks experiments
- Generates visualizations

3. **Trading Strategy Analysis**:
```bash
python strategy_analysis.py
```
- Implements trading strategies  
- Performs backtesting  
- Generates performance reports

## Handling Network Failures with `backoff`

In [`analyzer.py`](src/market_analyzer/analyzer.py), we wrap our Yahoo Finance data download logic with **exponential backoff** for transient issues (like network blips). For example:

```python
import backoff
import requests

@backoff.on_exception(
    backoff.expo,
    (requests.exceptions.ConnectionError, requests.exceptions.Timeout),
    max_tries=5
)
def _download_with_backoff(symbol, period):
    # ...
```

This prevents random connection failures from breaking the entire download process and retries up to five times.

### Notes

- The **exact** wording is up to you, but do be sure to highlight both **TA‑Lib** and **backoff** in your installation steps and mention how you use them.  
- If your `requirements.txt` file already includes `ta-lib` and `backoff`, you can simply mention `pip install -r requirements.txt`—but still note the special instructions for TA‑Lib on Windows.
